WP-VeriteCo-Timeline (fixing)
====================

"Fork" from [youngbhs](http://profiles.wordpress.org/youngbhs/)'s [WP VeriteCo Timeline](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-veriteco-timeline/) plugin. Based on 1.0 version published 2012-8-26

## Fixes: ##

* Accent dont display. [Solution proposed by aimad22](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/accent-don-t-display-1)
* Unlimited timeline entries. Timeline entries were limited by 'posts_per_page' option in the original plugin.


## TODO ##

* Choose the timeline's language, using .js files in `/js/locale/`
